# SDD Decisions Log

> **Append-only event log.** Every approval, phase transition, and
> notable decision gets one entry. Future-you reads this to remember
> WHY past-you committed to something — patterns.md captures the
> *what* and *how*; this file captures the *when* and *why*.
>
> **Enforced**: `pre-commit-rules.sh` (via `file_rules: append_only`
> in `config.md`) blocks any commit that removes or modifies an
> existing entry. Edits to past entries fail the pre-commit hook
> with a plain-English error.
>
> **Format**: each entry is one Markdown level-2 section:
>
> ```text
> ## <ISO-Z timestamp>  [<work-item-id>]  <playbook>/<action>
> <one-paragraph summary in plain English of what was decided>
> Hash: <sha256 if section was approved> (optional)
> ```
>
> Append entries with `>>` from the agent's command. Never `>` (would
> overwrite). If decisions.md is genuinely corrupt and needs rebuilding,
> that's a manual recovery operation outside the framework's contract —
> restore from a known-good commit, don't squash history forward.
