# Tier 3 LLM-driven synthesis

[PHASE: SPEC]

**Active blocker:** §5 (proposed-approach — AGENT-LED, requires user approval)

## PHASE: SPEC

### action: problem

- [x] who: agent + Sam (primary in v1.1); future teammates + downstream adopters (later — design must not preclude them)
- [x] why-now: complex projects need full-picture agent + token efficiency — both co-equal drivers, not one then the other
- [x] what-breaks: roadmap velocity wall — Sam ends up patching agent-memory issues instead of shipping features

### action: success

- [x] metric: dual co-equal — (1) quality: ≥80% of synthesised answers cite-check correctly on framework corpus (baseline: no synthesis exists today); (2) cost: avg synthesised answer <1 KB (baseline: Tier 2 returns ~5–20 KB raw chunks per question)

### action: user-stories

- [x] stories: 5 stories — agent (mid-SPEC pattern lookup, /ship learn synthesis) + Sam (decision recall, milestone sweep, health review); freshness routed to §10 non-functional

**The 5 stories:**

1. **Agent — mid-SPEC pattern lookup.** As the SDD agent walking §5 proposed-approach, I want to ask *"is there already a pattern for X in this project?"* and get a synthesised answer with cited corpus chunks, so that I lock onto an existing pattern instead of inventing a duplicate and don't burn 20 KB re-reading every related spec.

2. **Agent — /ship lessons synthesis.** As the SDD agent at /ship time running the `learn` action, I want to ask *"what should this feature contribute to patterns.md, given what we shipped vs what already exists?"* and get a synthesised proposal with cited support, so that the lessons-learned block is a corpus-aware diff rather than a hand-typed guess.

3. **Sam — decision recall.** As the project owner days or weeks after a decision was made, I want to ask *"why did we pick X for project Y?"* and get the matching decisions.md entry quoted with a citation, so that I don't have to grep decisions.md by hand or re-read context I'll have forgotten.

4. **Sam — milestone sweep.** As the project owner planning the next milestone, I want to ask *"list every [PROD-ONLY] AC across all shipped features"* and get a synthesised list with citations, so that I can sweep the deferred prod-verifications without manually walking each feature folder.

5. **Sam — health review.** As the project owner reviewing project health, I want to ask *"what TODOs / deferred items have piled up across all in-flight features?"* and get a synthesised list with citations, so that nothing gets lost in the in-flight tier and I can triage them in one sitting.

**Cross-cutting (carried to §10 non-functional):** every synthesised answer must reflect the latest corpus state at retrieval time, not a stale cache. The graph cache is already content-hash invalidated at v1.0; Tier 3 must inherit that freshness guarantee. The spec must verify in SHIP that synthesis cannot serve stale answers.

### action: ux-brief

- [x] brief: feels like a knowledgeable-colleague you can ask anything about your project, with receipts; one core call with structured/prose views; inline [[…]] citations; ambiguity surfaced; empty results spelled out; <1 KB default length

**The chosen UX direction:** Tier 3 should feel like *a knowledgeable colleague you can ask anything about your project, who always shows their receipts.*

**Three concrete moments it produces (approved verbatim, 2026-05-01):**

1. **Sam asks** — *"Why did we pick Postgres for the waitlist?"* → *"Postgres was picked because the v1 schema is small enough to colocate with the app — you flagged this in [[001-waitlist]] about a month ago. Switching to a managed database came up in [[005-pivot]] but you parked it."*
2. **Agent asks (mid-SPEC)** — *"Is there already a pattern for retrying failed signups in this project?"* → structured data response (yes/no + citation) the agent reads directly. Same brain, different wrapping for the consumer.
3. **Sam asks** — *"What's deferred across all my features right now?"* → *"Three things deferred: cookie consent banner ([[002-checkout]]), Stripe webhook retry ([[004-billing]]), import CSV (parked, [[007-onboarding]]). Want me to expand on any of them?"*

**Three design choices that produce that feel:**

- **One core synthesise call, two views.** A single MCP query (likely named `synthesise`) with a `format: "structured" | "prose"` argument. Agent calls it with `format: "structured"` for direct consumption; the slash-command wrapper calls with `format: "prose"` for chat. Same LLM call, same cite-check, two thin renderers.
- **Inline `[[wiki-link]]` citations** in the prose path. Reuses v1.0's graph cache. Click to jump in editors that render Obsidian-style links; readable as text otherwise.
- **Knowledgeable-colleague voice.** Plain English, declarative, no "I think" hedging. Where the corpus is silent, say so explicitly.

**Behavioural guarantees (must verify in SHIP):**

- **No invention.** Every claim must point at a real `[[…]]` — graph cache verifies the link resolves, or the answer is rejected.
- **Ambiguity surfaced, not picked.** Two valid answers → *"two candidates — [[001]] says X, [[005]] says Y. Which do you mean?"*
- **Empty corpus spelled out.** No silent return. *"Nothing in your project covers that. Closest was [[X]] but tangential. Want me to broaden?"*
- **Length cap.** Default answer < 1 KB (matches §2 cost target). Expand-on-demand for deeper dives.
